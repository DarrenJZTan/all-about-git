# README

**Welcome to Le Wagon's 'Collaborate with Git' Workshop!**

This workshop will cover the basics of git but then go a bit further to explore what it is like to work on a team and manage a project with collaboration.

The All About Git repo was created just for this workshop and will continue as an open-source project for collaborators to use as practice, but also in the hopes of building a Git wiki that can be published and accessed by anyone. So please, contribute, contribute, contribute, but with the foresight of building a well-maintained and reliable Git wiki.
